# Introduction 

I would like to firs start this introduction by making a few important comments about this first case. This will probably the only case that will differ from any future analysis documentations due to the environment in which it took place. The analysis occurred on a desktop that was given to me, but was provided with very little information other it possibly being infected. Given the nature of it and my very early understanding of malware, the approach demonstrates a rough walk through, but the documentation will be as the events took place and nothing else. 
## Overview

This brief overview includes key information of what is known about the type of infection and also what can be predicted.

- **Name/Identifier:** The name of the infection is still unknown.
- **Type:** RAT Trojan, Cryptominer, Spyware.
- **Date Analyzed:** 12/15/24.
- **Analysis Environment:** Windows 10, HP Intel Pentium, Older model desktop.
- **Threat Level:** High.

Being that no further information was given to myself and being that I am not aware of any crucial information. A similar comparison example to this case would highly resemble what is known as ==Black Box== penetration testing. And did have a very early understanding of that the root of this may not be uncovered but its understanding how the infection is acting, and how it could have taken place.

## Behavioral Analysis

Before diving into the behavioral analysis I would like to also clarify that during initial set up it was key not connect this machine to the internet. Being that the type of possible infection is unknown I did not want to place the machine itself at more risk or other devices. This idea would then keep the machine isolated and give us the opportunity to see what kind of behavior it last recorded. 

Once booted, these are some of the behavioral tings I noticed:
-  **CPU/Memory:** Within task manager the use percentage of CPU and Memory were high, more than what you'd expect or consider to be "regular".  From my understanding after viewing what applications are currently running and being that none necessarily look suspicious, this leads me to believe that there's a chance of this unknown malware hiding itself behind actual windows applications or services. This was my first realization that this might take time.
- **Privileges:** A lot of folders, applications, or services had their permissions changed. Keep in mind that from what I was told this was more of  a "home" computer, so it makes me questions why there was such a restriction on a majority of things? Unless this was a result of a RAT/Trojan, but the search continues.
- **Performance:**  Being that memory usage is high, their is a lot latency or delay that happens between changing folders and applications or simply anything. It is very difficult to move from one area to another.
- **Programs:** An vast amount of downloads that some help where this infection might have came from, but just from visually scanning files there is so much that is all over the system. One thing that does stand out to me the most is that if this was a case of a remote connection or anything along that idea, the fact that WSL was installed and it cant be ran seems very suspicious. 

## Static and Dynamic Analysis 

Now that I have an idea of the behavior of this machine, I went ahead and used a a variety of tools and analyze potential programs that might contain answers to this infection. This was possible through the use of a USB flash drive that contained different programs such as disassemblers, decompiles, and some AV programs.

- **Detect it Easy:** I decided to bring over this tool so that I can analyze various aspects of the different programs or services that did quite look legitimate. This tool allows me to analyze the Hex, Strings, Memory, Strings, Entropy and more. Most importantly if a program was packed or not because this can also tell me where the initial intrusion came from. 
- **HxD, x64dbg:** The same goes for these tools as well, these tools allows me to then analyze and see the Hex information behind programs, services, dlls, images and more. 
- **ESET Emergency Kit:** From the attempts of using other portable AVs to then try and clean/scan the machine this was the only one that was able to use offline, though this did come back as clear which can either indicate a couple of things to me. Either this malware is possibly embedded deep in the system at this point will not be detected by most AVs, or being that the machine is offline it doesn't allow the infection to move around which then isnt detected but the chances of that being the case is lower, and finally going back to that first point this can be some type of root kit, or a type of infection that at this point has already enumerated itself into the Kernal, BIOS, EUFI. 

Different system contents were found to be packed, and some of the services in there were a bit suspicious. I will include images of these instances separately just so that I can keep this report clean and without making it difficult to read through. 

I would like to say that from my interpretation this machine seems to be heavily heavily infected to the point of like hardware, UEFI level, or close to level 0 already. Being that some of the memory called that i noticed did call to KERNAL, and more. Not sure if even a format and reimage would save this machine, since it seems like whoever first infected the machine took its time to then go through and slowly modify a great majority of files. 

**Possible type of infection:** The type of infection to me feels like it was some type of Trojan/RAT, a rootkit, or some type of crypto miner. My reasonings for this is because there is to be a server file that is found in the machine! Meaning remote access, files to be shared, files to get, keylogging. It seems to me that this machine was possibly left attended for some times and the attacker really buried himself deep into this machine. I know so much analysis can be done, but I fear hooking this up to the internet to see what more happens when this machine has an internet connection running.  

## Indicators of Compromise

Still not clear but from what I can analyze from this machine is that a possible indication of compromise had to be through a download, more so specifically an android simulator. Since a lot of these files when opened with Detect it Easy show a trial that leads back to that application. I would like to say that this individual got deep enough in the kill chain to where he has a hook on this machine. Leading me to believe that even format and reinstall wont do much. As it seems as if this infection will persist.

## Recommendation

A possible solution that came to mind was formatting the drive and doing a fresh install of the windows ISO or a Linux ISO, but being that I suspect this machine is already infected close to the hardware level or level 0 I am unsure if that can work. But any possible suggestions can definitely help.

## Conclusion

To conclude this report it is clear to me that the machine is infected, and through the analysis procedures made it leads me to believe that there might be 1 or 2 possibly more type of infections that were done to the computer. Being that I cannot really pin point the initial IOC, and also how many "junk" can be found it makes it even more difficult to determine. I really hope that whoever took the time to read this can leave some input! All opinions, solutions, suggestions and more are all appreciated, it would definitely help to expand my understanding of malware analysis. 

Thank you,
