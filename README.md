# Malware Documentation

The documentation contained herein outlines various malware analysis scenarios conducted independently by myself to enhance my understanding and expertise in the field of malware analysis


## Summary

This documentation reflects my ongoing work in malware analysis, aimed at expanding my understanding of the field. While Iâ€™m not yet an expert, this serves as both training and a way to track my progress as I explore areas like static and dynamic analysis, reverse engineering, and the examination of malicious code. As I upload more content, expect to see increasingly detailed cases that highlight my growth and learning in malware analysis.
## System Setup/Deployment

The current system setup involves two primary Windows 11 machines, with virtual machines (VMs) deployed on each for malware analysis. This setup is designed to provide flexibility and isolation, but may evolve as more analyses are conducted.

Primary Systems:  
â€¢ Two Windows 11 machines will serve as the main workstations.  
â€¢ Virtual machines will be deployed on either of these systems for running isolated analysis environments.

Virtual Machines:  
â€¢Kali Linux VMs and Parrot OS VMs will be frequently used for analysis, offering powerful tools for penetration testing and security research.  
â€¢Both Kali Linux and Parrot OS may also be used as full installations (not just VMs),  

Isolation Strategy:  
â€¢The use of VMs ensures that malware can be contained within isolated environments, preventing any potential spread to host systems.  
â€¢Network configurations will be set up with strong isolation practices to further secure the environment, minimizing the risk of malware propagation.
Dynamic Setup:

The system setup is not fully fixed and may evolve based on the analysis requirements and approaches.

Security Considerations:  
â€¢The network configuration will prioritize security, ensuring that any malware analyzed cannot spread to other machines or networks.  
â€¢This setup will evolve over time as more analysis is conducted and new security challenges arise.
